# 🚀 DeepFlow: Data to Deep Learning to Deployment

Welcome to **DeepFlow**, a hands-on, end-to-end journey through solving real-world problems using data science and deep learning — all the way to deployment!

## 🔍 Overview

**DeepFlow** walks you through a full data science and ML pipeline:
- Start with messy, real-world data
- Clean and preprocess it for insights
- Apply ML models for regression & classification
- Dive into deep learning (CNNs, Transfer Learning)
- Finally, **deploy your models using FastAPI** for real-world applications

This is a **practical**, application-first project. The goal is to build working systems, not just study theory.
